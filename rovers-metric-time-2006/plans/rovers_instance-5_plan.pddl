- Duration of (recharge rover0 waypoint0) is not constant-bounded
Non-constant-bounded duration-dependent effect ((energy rover0) +=15.000*?duration) makes effects on 0 be order-dependent
- Duration of (recharge rover1 waypoint0) is not constant-bounded
Non-constant-bounded duration-dependent effect ((energy rover1) +=17.000*?duration) makes effects on 1 be order-dependent
